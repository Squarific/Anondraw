Hey,

I saw you stream yourself making art. I have a website where artists can draw live with other people.
It allows you to create a room where you can draw with your viewers. Would you like to check it out?

The address: http://www.anondraw.com

If you want to create a room for you and your viewers follow these steps:

1) Go into one of the modes
2) Click on the "Account" button
3) Create your account
4) Press the room button
5) Click on "join own room"
6) You can now give people permission to draw

If you want everyone to be able to join you without giving them permission simply create a normal private room.

Let me know if you have any feedback!

Regards,
Anondraw Dev
