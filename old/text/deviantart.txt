Hello,

I'd like to introduce a website I made called anondraw. It's a website that allows you to draw live collaborations with other people. It currently has 3 types of rooms: public, private and member.

It works using a reputation system where more reputation = more permissions. For example people with 50R+ can ban trolls. This makes for a nice community driven environment.

Do you think this sounds awesome? Then join us: http://www.anondraw.com

Let me know what you guys and gals think!

Regards,

Urban
